# Battle Pong
An entry-level Godot project that aims to build upon Coding with Russ's Pong tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq9AyhX8HUc) with added functionality for a future Itch.io release
First Godot Project to start learning game development.

Play the game here: https://krutterlax.itch.io/battle-pong

Added mechanics:

- Hold **'Shift'** for speed boost while moving the paddle.

- Press **'R'** to restart the game at any time

- Press and hold **'E'** to 'grab' the ball and move it around before shooting it. This allows you to "aim" it.

- Added dynamic sounds such as fade-in music, scoring points and hitting the ball with the pitch being set by the current ball speed.

- Added win condition to reach a score of 3
